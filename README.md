# Number Recognition Neural Network

<p>Basic handwritten number recognition (Python3, tensorflow + keras, MNIST dataset).</p>

<p>This program uses tensorflow.keras to identify handwritten numbers using a sequential neural network with 3 layers. On the right you can see an example for the accuracy and loss that is achieved after seven epochs.
