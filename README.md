# Number Recognition Neural Network

<img src="./img/acc_and_loss.png" alt="Accuracy and loss" title="Model accuracy and loss" width="280" height="466" align="right" /> 
<p>Basic handwritten number recognition using Python3 and the following modules:
<ul>
<li>tensorflow

<ul>
<li>keras (datasets, sequential, callbacks...)</li>
<li>tensorboard (e.g. program)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sys</li>
<li>importlib</li>
<li>subprocess</li>
<li>time</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This program uses tensorflow.keras to identify handwritten numbers using a sequential neural network with 3 layers. On the right you can see an example for the accuracy and loss that is achieved after seven epochs. Below is a visual representation of the network created using TensorBoard. If you want to create such a graph yourself just run the program.</p>
